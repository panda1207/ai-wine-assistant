## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

1. **App.tsx**
   - Root component with navigation setup
   - State management for chat and messages
   - Integration layer between chatbox and product detail

2. **ChatBox.tsx**
   - Reusable chat component
   - Animated minimize/expand transitions
   - Keyboard-aware input handling
   - Quick replies and typing indicators

3. **ProductDetailScreen.tsx**
   - Scroll-aware sticky elements
   - Swipeable image gallery
   - Accordion sections for content organization
   - Horizontal scrolling recommendations

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useRef) for local state
- Props drilling for simple parent-child communication
- No external state management library (appropriate for this scope)

### Navigation
- React Navigation Stack Navigator
- Screen integration with overlay components (ChatBox)

### Styling
- StyleSheet API for performance
- Responsive design with Dimensions API
- Platform-specific adjustments
- Consistent design tokens (colors, spacing)

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Mobile-First Approach
- **Viewport**: Optimized for 390-414px width (iPhone standard)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
- **Typography**: Readable font sizes (14-18px for body text)
- **Spacing**: Generous padding for thumb-friendly interactions

### Information Hierarchy
1. Visual appeal (images) comes first
2. Essential purchasing info (price, stock)
3. Quality indicators (ratings, badges)
4. Detailed information (expandable sections)
5. Cross-sell opportunities (recommendations)

### Interaction Patterns
- **Swipe**: Image gallery navigation
- **Tap**: Expand/collapse sections, chat toggle
- **Scroll**: Primary navigation method
- **Quick Actions**: Floating buttons for chat and back navigation

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: #B72E61 (Wine red) - CTAs, branding
- **Success**: #4caf50 - Stock availability
- **Error**: #d32f2f - Out of stock, errors
- **Neutral**: Grays for text hierarchy

## 📊 Mock Data Assumptions

### Products
- All product data is mocked with realistic wine information
- Images use placeholders (via.placeholder.com)
- Prices, ratings, and reviews are fictional
- Stock counts are simulated

### Chat Messages
- Pre-loaded conversation history
- AI responses are simulated with setTimeout
- Product references link to mock product data
- User identity is anonymous

### API Simulation
- No actual backend calls
- 1.5-second delay for "AI thinking"
- Error states shown for demonstration purposes

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

- **Animations**: Using native driver where possible
- **Images**: Would implement lazy loading in production
- **Lists**: Would use FlatList for long scrolling lists
- **Memory**: Components unmount properly to prevent leaks

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

If this were a production app, consider:

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Real API calls to wine database
   - Actual AI/LLM integration for chat
   - User authentication and profiles

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Shopping cart with checkout flow
   - Wine recommendations based on preferences
   - AR bottle preview
   - Social sharing

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Image caching and optimization
   - Redux or Context API for complex state
   - Analytics tracking
   - Offline support

4. **Accessibility**
   - Screen reader support
   - High contrast mode
   - Adjustable font sizes
   - Voice commands

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

For production, implement:
- Unit tests (Jest) for business logic
- Component tests (React Native Testing Library)
- E2E tests (Detox) for critical user flows
- Visual regression tests
- Accessibility audits

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Choices

1. **Expo vs React Native CLI**: Chose Expo for rapid prototyping and easier deployment
2. **TypeScript**: Type safety for better developer experience
3. **React Navigation**: Industry standard for React Native routing
4. **Inline Styles**: StyleSheet API for performance and type safety
5. **No UI Library**: Custom components to match exact requirements

### Trade-offs Made

- **Simplicity over Scalability**: Simple prop drilling instead of Redux
- **Mocked Data**: Focus on UI/UX over backend complexity
- **Limited Animations**: Focused on essential interactions
- **Single Screen Flow**: Demonstrated integration without full app structure

### Production Considerations

- Environment variables for API endpoints
- Secure storage for user tokens
- Analytics integration (Firebase, Mixpanel)
- Error boundary components
- Crash reporting (Sentry)
- App Store compliance (privacy policy, GDPR)

## 🔍 How This Addresses Requirements

### Chatbox Requirements
 **Entry & Persistence**: Floating button, minimized state, badge notification  
 **Conversation Flow**: Messages, typing indicators, quick replies, error states  
 **System Integration**: Product reference cards link to detail page  

### Product Detail Requirements
 **Content Stack**: All required elements in prioritized order  
 **Interaction Moments**: Swipe gallery, accordion sections, sticky CTA  
 **Decision Support**: Badges, expert reviews, pairings, provenance  

### Evaluation Criteria
 **Realistic Mobile Experience**: Authentic mobile patterns and interactions  
 **Information Hierarchy**: Prioritized for small screens  
 **Quality Reasoning**: Documented assumptions and trade-offs  
 **Engineering Clarity**: Clear component structure and implementation notes  
 **Clear Materials**: Comprehensive README and inline code comments
